![Open a Markdown file and write in the rendered view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/77fe1f0d8a388da2dd20ede7efb6065dc2e1f96a/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/hero.gif)

*Open any `.md` file, write in the rendered view, and use the Markdown shortcuts you already know: `##` for a heading, `[ ]` for a task, `Cmd/Ctrl+B` for bold.*

## Install

- **VS Code:** [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=concretio.markdown-for-humans), or search `concretio.markdown-for-humans` in Extensions.
- **Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium and other Open VSX IDEs:** [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/concretio/markdown-for-humans), or search the same ID in Extensions.

> **📌 100% free. No trials. No limits. No paywalls, ever.**

## Why Markdown for Humans

- **Your file stays your file.** Blocks you do not edit keep their exact source on save, so Git diffs show only what you changed.
- **Tables and images without syntax.** Edit tables visually; resize and rename images from the editor.
- **Review what your AI agent wrote.** Comment on the rendered plan, then hand a sealed feedback file to Claude Code, Codex or any agent.
- **Opt-in, never a takeover.** It opens only when you choose it, and you can make it your default for `.md` files.

## Tables Without Pipes

![Add a row with Tab, then insert a column from the right-click menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/77fe1f0d8a388da2dd20ede7efb6065dc2e1f96a/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/tables.gif)

- **Tab** to the next cell; Tab in the last cell adds a row
- **Right-click** any cell to insert or delete rows and columns
- **Set Column Width** from a cell's right-click menu; explicit widths are saved in an HTML `<colgroup>`
- **Toolbar** controls for inserting and editing tables
- **Text color** for selected text; colored text is saved as an inline HTML `<span>`

*Stop counting pipes and dashes.*

## Review AI-Written Markdown

Plans, specs and `CLAUDE.md` files are easier to review rendered. Start a review, comment on as many places as you need, then hand the whole set to your agent in one sealed file.

**Comment on anything in one pass:** selected text, a nested list item, a table row, or part of a code block. Hover a block for the comment button in the left rail; **Change scope** widens or narrows the target.

![Review a plan from Claude: comment on selected text, a nested list item, a table row and a code selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/1c4c33dcac719ec396ab820c46f0ff5a2d904aee/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/feedback-review-comments.gif)

**Mark up a screenshot, see every comment in the side rail, then submit.** Capture an area when words are not enough, edit any saved comment from its card, and click **Finish & copy**.

![Capture and circle part of a diagram, comment on a section, edit a saved comment in the side rail, then Finish & copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/1c4c33dcac719ec396ab820c46f0ff5a2d904aee/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/feedback-review-rail-finish.gif)

1. Open a saved Markdown file in a workspace and click the first toolbar button, **Log feedback for an LLM**.
2. Add as many comments as you need: on text, blocks, list items, table cells, or captured areas.
3. Click **Finish & copy**. The bundle is sealed under `.md4h/feedback/` and a handoff prompt is on your clipboard.
4. Paste the prompt into Claude Code, Codex, or any workspace-aware agent.

The document is locked while you review, so your comments always point at the source the agent will read. [How the feedback file works →](docs/FEEDBACK.md)

**The view keeps up while your agent works.** When a terminal, an agent, or Git changes the file on disk, the rendered view updates in place.

## Images That Manage Themselves

![Resize an image from its menu; the original is backed up first](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/77fe1f0d8a388da2dd20ede7efb6065dc2e1f96a/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/image-resize.gif)

- **Resize** to a new width from the image menu, with the original backed up under `.md4h/image-backups/`
- **Rename** an image from its menu: the file is renamed on disk and the Markdown link is updated
- **Size suggestions** for oversized images, to keep your repo small
- **Hover details:** dimensions, file size and path at a glance
- **Drag and drop or paste** images into the document

![Hover for image details, then rename the file from the editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/77fe1f0d8a388da2dd20ede7efb6065dc2e1f96a/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/image-rename.gif)

Local SVG images render as vectors, and importing one keeps the original file untouched. Use **Image options > Display size** to set the width of one occurrence, with normal undo; explicit sizes are saved as an HTML `<img width="…">`, and unsized images stay ordinary Markdown. Rename and hover details work for SVGs too, and PDF export keeps them at their sizes. See [Known Issues](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md#svg-images) for SVG limits.

## Diagrams, Math, Alerts and Code

![Edit Mermaid source beside the rendered view and watch the diagram update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/77fe1f0d8a388da2dd20ede7efb6065dc2e1f96a/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/mermaid.gif)

- **Mermaid diagrams:** edit the source beside the rendered view and the diagram updates as you type; 15 templates; double-click a diagram to edit it in place
- **Math:** LaTeX equations rendered with KaTeX
- **GitHub alerts:** Note, Tip, Important, Warning and Caution callouts
- **Code blocks:** syntax highlighting for 11+ languages, with a copy button

## Navigate and Share

![Jump to a section from the outline, then search the document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/77fe1f0d8a388da2dd20ede7efb6065dc2e1f96a/marketplace-assets/gifs/v2/outline-search.gif)

- **Document outline** to jump between headings in long documents
- **In-document search** with match highlighting
- **Export** to PDF or Word for people outside your repo
- **Word count and reading time** in the status bar
- **Theme aware:** follows your VS Code theme, fonts and font size

## FAQ

**VS Code now has a built-in Markdown editor. Why use this?**
VS Code 1.131 added an experimental hybrid Markdown editor, aimed at the Agents window. Markdown for Humans works in every VS Code window and in Open VSX IDEs such as Cursor and Windsurf. It adds visual table editing, image resize and rename, Mermaid editing, PDF and Word export, and a sealed feedback handoff for any agent.

**Will it change my file?**
Only the blocks you edit. Unedited blocks keep their exact source on save. Edited blocks use a standard Markdown form, listed in [Known Issues](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

**How do I make it my default Markdown editor?**
Right-click a `.md` file, choose **Open With...**, then **Configure default editor for '*.md'...** and pick Markdown for Humans.

**Dropping an image does nothing.**
Hold **Shift** while you drop: VS Code requires it for drops into an editor. In Cursor, drags from the workspace explorer are often not detected; use the image insert dialog or drop from Finder.

**How do I see the raw Markdown?**
Click the **Source** button in the toolbar to open the source beside the rendered view.

## Why We Built This

**Writing should feel natural, not technical.** You shouldn't need to memorize syntax, dig through command palettes, or fight with your tools. You should just write.

Existing markdown editors force writers to choose between split-pane previews that waste screen space, plain text editing that requires memorizing syntax, standalone apps that don't integrate with your workflow, or command-heavy interfaces that bury actions in overloaded palettes.

We built Markdown for Humans to solve the **real pain points**, tables and images, that make markdown editing frustrating, while keeping the underlying file as plain markdown so Git diffs, tooling, and other editors still work.

## Vibe Coded its way

This extension was built through AI / **vibe coding**, with minimal human effort focused on fixes and stability. The basic functional model came together in minutes, but what took days and hours was **testing each feature** to ensure everything works smoothly in real-world use. 

It's the classic 80:20 rule in action: that final 20% of polish, edge cases, and real-world testing takes 80% of the time, and that's where the real value lives.

We're open-sourcing this because in AI era, **code has limited value**, the real work was in the creativity in planning, design, and relentless testing. 

Countless hours went into vibe-coded wireframes, user experience design, and polish to create something that feels natural and intuitive.
